Abstract
The COVID-19 outbreak has presented substantial obstacles for the train sector, requiring
flexible approaches and effective distribution of resources to guarantee secure and
dependable operations. Accurate prediction of passenger demand has become vital for
train operators in this ever-changing situation. This investigation seeks to utilize machine
learning methods to accomplish precise traveler demand forecasting in the railway sector
amidst the pandemic. Line-oriented and stop-oriented prediction approaches are
examined, taking into account a broad spectrum of factors, such as time-related elements
and characteristics associated with the pandemic. Different machine learning algorithms,
such as artificial neural networks, stochastic forests, and profound learning structures,
are examined to generate anticipatory frameworks that seize intricate arrangements and
connections in the information. Historical traveler information and pandemic-associated
data, like contagion rates and immunization levels, are combined to comprehend the
unique impacts of the pandemic on traveler desire. The investigation seeks to offer
valuable perspectives and functional implementations for the train sector amidst the
pandemic, optimizing resource distribution and improving passenger contentment.
